To accomplish this use data from the past three days, which includes information such as the **mean temperature**, **humidity**, **wind speed**, and **mean pressure**. The goal is to employ LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, to effectively forecast the future mean temperature based on the provided historical data.\n",
